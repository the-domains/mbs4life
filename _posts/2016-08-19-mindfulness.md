  If there was a way to be happier and protect your mind and body against

It' time that we as health and fitness of of various factions bridge the gaps. Competition is a great tool

Elite competitors understand the value of cooperation and doing what works. Once upon a time athletes avoided strength training thinking it will slow them down and inhibit there skills. Now I cannot think of a sport where strength training is not mandatory. Golf was probably the last sport to get it!

At one time yoga and meditation were seen as tools for relaxation that were reserved for hippies and gurus and so on. Mindfulness wasn'nt even a word in recent history. Boy have these things changed today!

Mindfulness, meditation, yoga are now commonplace in athletics, especially amongst the athletic elite!
